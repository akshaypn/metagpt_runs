## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Main"),
    ("game.py", "Game"),
    ("cli.py", "CLI"),
    ("ascii_art.py", "ASCIIArt"),
    ("utils.py", "Utils"),
    ("deck.py", "Deck"),
    ("player.py", "Player"),
    ("dealer.py", "Dealer"),
]
```

## Task list:

```python
[
    "utils.py",
    "ascii_art.py",
    "deck.py",
    "player.py",
    "dealer.py",
    "game.py",
    "cli.py",
    "main.py",
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'utils.py' file contains utility functions that can be used across the project.

The 'ascii_art.py' file contains functions to generate ASCII art for the game.

The 'deck.py' file contains the implementation of the Deck class, which represents a deck of cards.

The 'player.py' file contains the implementation of the Player class, which represents a player in the game.

The 'dealer.py' file contains the implementation of the Dealer class, which represents the dealer in the game.

The 'game.py' file contains the implementation of the Game class, which controls the flow of the game.

The 'cli.py' file contains the implementation of the CLI class, which handles the command-line interface of the game.

The 'main.py' file is the entry point of the application and creates instances of the necessary classes to start the game.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR:

The task dependencies are clear and the main entry point is provided in the 'main.py' file. The initialization of the required third-party libraries should be done before starting the game.
