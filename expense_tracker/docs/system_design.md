## Implementation approach:
For this expense tracking application, we will use the following open-source frameworks and tools:

1. React: We will build the frontend of the application using React, as it provides a robust and efficient way to create user interfaces.

2. Django: We will use Django, a high-level Python web framework, to handle the backend of the application. Django provides a clean and efficient way to handle data models, views, and templates.

3. Pandas: We will use the Pandas library to handle the import and export of expense data in CSV format. Pandas provides powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities.

4. Matplotlib: For generating visualizations and insights based on the expense data, we will use the Matplotlib library. Matplotlib is a popular plotting library in Python and provides a wide range of visualization options.

5. Flask: We will use Flask, a lightweight web framework, to create a RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend of the application.
