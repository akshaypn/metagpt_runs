## Original Requirements:
The boss wants to create a simple react-based application that takes in the expenses of a month as a CSV (from multiple accounts) and shows a calendar-based UI that shows the credit/debit for each day when it is clicked.

## Requirement Analysis:
The product should be a user-friendly and efficient expense tracking application that allows users to import expenses from multiple accounts in CSV format. It should provide a calendar-based UI to visualize daily credit/debit and allow users to click on specific days to see detailed information. The application should also generate visualizations and insights based on the expense data. Additionally, it should allow users to export their expense data in CSV format.

## Requirement Pool:
```python
[
    ("Import expenses from multiple accounts in CSV format", "P0"),
    ("Calendar-based UI to visualize daily credit/debit", "P0"),
    ("Click on specific days to see detailed information", "P0"),
    ("Generate visualizations and insights based on expense data", "P1"),
    ("Export expense data in CSV format", "P1")
]
```

## UI Design draft:
The application will have a clean and intuitive interface. The main screen will display a calendar view where users can see their expenses for each day. Clicking on a specific day will show the credit/debit for that day in a pop-up window. The application will also have a sidebar with options to import and export expense data. Visualizations and insights will be displayed in a separate section of the UI. The overall style will be modern and minimalistic, with a focus on usability and readability.

## Anything UNCLEAR:
There are no unclear points.
