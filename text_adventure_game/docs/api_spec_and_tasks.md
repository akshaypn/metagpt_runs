## Logic Analysis:
```python
[
    ("main.py", "Contains the main entry point of the game"),
    ("game.py", "Contains the Game class with methods for starting, ending, saving, and loading the game"),
    ("room.py", "Contains the Room class with methods for adding and removing objects, and getting objects"),
    ("object.py", "Contains the Object class with a method for interacting with the object"),
    ("puzzle.py", "Contains the Puzzle class with methods for solving the puzzle"),
    ("database.py", "Contains the Database class with methods for saving and loading the game state"),
    ("utils.py", "Contains the Utils class with a method for generating random numbers")
]
```

## Task list:
```python
[
    "utils.py",
    "database.py",
    "object.py",
    "puzzle.py",
    "room.py",
    "game.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:
```python
"""
The 'utils.py' file contains the Utils class with a method called 'get_random_number' that can be used to generate random numbers.

The 'database.py' file contains the Database class with methods for saving and loading the game state.

The 'object.py' file contains the Object class with a method called 'interact' that can be used to interact with the object.

The 'puzzle.py' file contains the Puzzle class with a method called 'solve' that can be used to solve the puzzle.

The 'room.py' file contains the Room class with methods for adding and removing objects, and getting objects.

The 'game.py' file contains the Game class with methods for starting, ending, saving, and loading the game.

The 'main.py' file contains the main entry point of the game.

## Anything UNCLEAR:
We need to clarify how the game should be started.
